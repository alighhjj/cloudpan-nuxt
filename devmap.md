# CalendarSync Pro - Development Map

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Product Overview
CalendarSync Pro is a Windows desktop application designed to aggregate and manage multiple calendar subscriptions from various sources including ICS files and CalDAV servers. The software provides a centralized interface for users to subscribe to, view, and manage multiple calendar feeds simultaneously.

### Problem Statement
Many users manage multiple calendar sources for work, personal events, sports schedules, holidays, and other activities. Current Windows calendar applications lack robust support for subscribing to multiple external calendar feeds, resulting in users having to open multiple applications or manually import calendar files.

2. **Calendar Display & Viewing**
   - Unified calendar view showing all subscribed calendars
   - Color-coded calendar sources for visual distinction
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly views
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Event preview without opening external applications

3. **Calendar Aggregation**
   - Consolidate events from multiple sources
   - Duplicate event detection and resolution
